	<p>I commute 4.5mi to work. There's a beautiful bike trail that forms a direct connection between my apartment and workplace. Originally, I had a road bike but two factors motivated me to build my own electric bike. 1) I have very long legs so my seat was very high and this stance on my road bike gave me terrible neck pain. 2) Each evening I ride straight into a 12mph headwind that blows off the bay every day. Other bikers on electric assisted bikes would fly past me as I trudged into the headwind. </p>

	<p>Therefore ... I made an electric bike.</p>

	<p>This bike is a mid-drive which means that the motor can make use of the gearing for better performance at high speed and up steep hills. I can easily get to 30mph on level ground. I estimate I can go 30 miles on a charge while traveling at 20mph. However, there are a couple determining variables that can drastically change your distance per charge. 1) How much you use the motor vs pedal yourself. 2) How fast you travel. The air drag increases exponential the faster you go and consequently efficiency drops the faster you go.</p>

	<p>Overall, I'm very pleased with the outcome; It's a joy to ride! If I were to build it again, I would save a few hundred dollars by getting a hard-tail mountain bike. This would've avoided some build issues I had to solve along the way. It also would've reduced the weight of the bike from 67lb to about 58lb while increasing the rigidity of the frame.</p>

	<p>I started with a 2001 trek mountain bike. The previous owner had updated virtually everything but frame and fork. The bike came with very nice new hydraulic brakes, new wheels, shifters, derailleurs,  hubs, seat, etc.</p>

	<div style="text-align: center">

	<p>The first thing to do was strip down the bike to just the frame. I had to peel off all the many stickers and wet sanded the old paint.</p>

	<p>Next I painted the frame in three steps.</p>

	<p>Although the motor is very simple and easy to install, there were some incompatibilities with my particular frame. The circles in red are where I had to grind down some points on both the main motor and the mounting bracket so that the lower triangle on the frame could have full movement. These would not be issues with a hard-tail bike.</p>

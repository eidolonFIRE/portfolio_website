	<p>This project took me about 6 hours to finish on a Friday evening.</p>

	<p>It runs on AAA rechargeables and shoots segments of a nail. It's not painful to get hit by, but it will shoot across the room pretty good! (it's not meant to be dangerous, just a cool desk toy)</p>

	<p>The charging circuit and capacitors are from disposable cameras and I used a generic relay that was laying around for the firing mechanism. Normally you wouldn't want to use a relay in a coilgun because the connecting terminals will be damaged over time. When they connect inside the relay, you are basically shorting a circuit through it and a lots of sparks fly off the terminals. The sparks are coming from the surface of the conductors super heating and burning off. Hence, they get damaged over time and don't conduct as well. (you want to use SCR's but I didn't have any extras)</p>

	<p>Overall I would say it's a success!</p>

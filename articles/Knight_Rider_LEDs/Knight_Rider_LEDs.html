	<p>This is something I did a many years back for my first lab in one of my engineering classes at VCU. I was super proud of the extremely compacted design. It is the first program I ever wrote in an assembly level language.</p>

	<p>The goal of the lab was to write a program in PIC18 assembly that will display the classic Knight Rider animation on 10 LEDs. This includes dimming the trailing lights to create the sweeping effect fully.</p>

	<p>There was a trick to this though, and that is that the chip only had 2 pwm modules and we weren't even allowed to use them.</p>

	<p>The solution most of my fellow students came up with was to create a loop with IO writes and pauses for EVER possible state the sweeping pattern could be in. The result was a bit tedious to produce but simple to understand. Some of the files I saw were hundreds and even a couple thousand instructions long.</p>

	<p>I was a bit surprised that nobody else oept'ed to take a different design route. I'm quite pleased with the result. It's a clever mechanism that consists of three main parts that all work together to generate the software pwm and sweeping pattern on the fly.</p>

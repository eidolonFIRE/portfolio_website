	<h1>Stir Plate</h1>

	<p>This project's function is to stir liquids without any contact with the solution via a magnetic stir bar. Stir plates are most commonly used in chemistry lab work but this one is going to be used for a much more noble cause... yeast culturing.</p>

	<p>It works much like any of the DIY stir plates out there. It has a magnet glued to a computer fan underneath the wood top. There's a 25 ohm rheostat connected in series with the fan to control the power.</p>

	<p>The power source is a 12v, 500mA wall-wort and the fan pulls 340mA when at full power. At full speed, there's about 4 watts of power going into the stirring of the liquid.</p>

	<p>Interesting note: I actually coated the top with fiberglass resin to make it waterproof... that's why the top of the box appears glazed.</p>

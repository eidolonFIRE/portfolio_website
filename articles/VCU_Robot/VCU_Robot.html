	<p>This Robot was the final project for class on micro controllers. It was created over the span of a semester and competed with the other classmate's robots for a final grade. It tied for first out of the three challenges.</p>
	
	<div>Challenges:</div>
	<ul>
		
		<li>Follow a line the fastest.</li>
		<li>Solve a large walled-in maze the fastest.</li>
		<li>Draw a picture with a mounted sharpie pen.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The design had a few key diffences that made it unique from the other robots.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Omni wheels used instead of "skid-steer". This was extremely advantagious in the drawing challenge.</li>
		<li>Two PIC controllers were used together to divide up the tasks. One read sensors and made all the logic decisions, while the other controlled the motors and tracked the robot's position. They communicated over serial.</li>
		<li>All the code for each challenge was built into the same program and the "challenge mode" was selected with DIP switches on power-on. This saved precious time between challenge runs as we didn't need to continuously reprogram the robot.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The PCBs were fully custom designed.</p>

	<p>The final drawing resault was very advanced compared to the other contestants. Because we had omniwheels, we didn't need to turn the robot inorder to draw shapes. I spend 90% of the time writing a solid navigational algorithm and 10% of the time typing in chordinates from a google image. This was very different from what other's were limited to with a "skid steer" system.</p>

	<p>My partner and I were vere proud when the whole room came to a standstill as our robot drew a galoping horse. The second place in this challenge drew the letter 'R'.</p>

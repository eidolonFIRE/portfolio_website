	<h1>Math Interpreter</h1>

	<p>This is a stack based math interpreter I made for personal enjoyment. Regrettably, the code is a messy but I don't have time to go back and clean it up.</p>

	<p>I made it mostly to educate myself in the ways of stack based math and reverse-polish-notation. Maybe someday I can re-use this in another project.</p>

	<p>The interpreter works as follows:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>User enters equation.</li>
		<li>Text is parsed into symbols.</li>
		<li>Symbols are rearranged into reverse-polish-notation... aka "postfix".</li>
		<li>Symbols are then put onto the stack as the final equation.</li>
		<li>Equation can then be calculated quickly and efficiently.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>As well as the basic operators like + - / * ^ ... sin(), cos(), tan(), log(), abs(), etc. are also available.</p>

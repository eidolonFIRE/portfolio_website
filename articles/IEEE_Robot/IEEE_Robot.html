	<p>I have just completed a circuit board for our VCU-IEEE robot. It will hold four <a href="http://www.pololu.com/product/1182">pololu stepper motor drivers</a> that will be controlling the four mecanum wheels. </p>

			<p>This spring break my team will be driving down to Kentucky to compete in the IEEE hardware competition and we need to have a reliable setup! This board will be able to handle the amount of power we need as well as be re-configurable. Notice the solder gabs at the center of each driver mounting. Those pads are accessible via the bottom and when the gab is soldered together it changes the micro-stepping mode of the driver. This should be set long before the competition but in the event it needs changed last minute... just grab an iron!</p>

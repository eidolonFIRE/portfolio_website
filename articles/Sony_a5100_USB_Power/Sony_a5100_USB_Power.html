	<p>I have recently purchased my first DSLR camera. It's a sony a5100. It's a great camera for video, but lacking some bells and whistles that can be found on many top shelf cameras. A particular feature that I wanted was a way to power the camera externally for time-lapse shoots or long car-mounted driving videos.</p>

	<p>The internal battery only lasts on hour in most cases and although the camera can charge the battery via USB, it will not run the camera on USB power.</p>

	<p>My solution is to combine an affordable USB battery brick, a buck-step DC-DC converter, and a wired dummy battery....</p>

	<p>The USB battery brick puts out 5V while the camera needs 7.4V - 8.1V. This is why the DC-DC converter was needed.</p>

	<p>Total Cost:</p>
	<div>$10  <a href="">LINK</a> ... four converters (backups since it was shipping from china)</div>
	<div>$20  <a href="">LINK</a> ... Wall adapter for camera (I only used the dummy battery)</div>
	<div>$30  <a href="">LINK</a> ... USB brick  (20x the capacity of the stock battery!)</div>
	<p>= $60</p>

	<p>The final product only required wired strippers, a drill bit, a mint tin, a multimeter, and a soldering iron to complete. It took me about 45 minutes. I can now power my camera for hours!</p>

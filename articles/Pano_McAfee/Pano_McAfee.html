	<h1>Pano: McAfee's Knob</h1>

	<p>This is actually a cropped down version of a HUGE panorama photo I took at McAfee's knob a long time ago. I did a day hike with a friend and got a chance to put my panorama tripod mount to the test.</p>

	<p>This image works nicely as a contiguous background across three 16/9 monitors. It fits perfectly if you put the background mode on "tile".</p>
